I am a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley working with Dr. Trevor Keenan. My research aims to build mechanistic understandings of carbon and vegetation dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems through novel combinations of data-driven and process-based approaches. I am interested in deriving generalizable frameworks of ecosystem processes from observational data, such as remote sensing and sensor networks, through machine learning and physical modeling. I use cloud or high-performance computing to accelerate and scale up my research.   
  
My past work has mainly focused on devising novel approaches to quantify Leaf Area Index and forecast crop yields at high spatial resolutions (Landsat and Sentinel2) over large regions. Currently, I am exploring emerging machine learning approaches to estimate global photosynthesis.
