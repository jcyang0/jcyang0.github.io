I am a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley working with Dr. Trevor Keenan in the Department of Environmental Sciency, Policy & Management. My current research interests center around the application of forest ecosystem ecology to directly address global environmental degradation through Nature-based Climate Solutions (NbCS).  NbCS can, ideally, contribute to the effort to limit global warming to 2Â°C while also producing co-benefits for ecosystem health, biodiversity, and local communities.  However, assessing the potential and impacts of NbCS projects is complex and large uncertainties remain a major barrier to successful implementation.  My work seeks to bring current state-of-the-art ecosystem carbon science to the NbCS multi-stakeholder space to help improve the quality and accounting of carbon removal projects worldwide.

My previous research broadly focused on how carbon and water cycling in forests responds to seasonal phenology and environmental constraints, including changing temperatures, drought, snowpack, or fire regimes.  I have worked in forests across the US asking questions that span scales of space and time using a combination of intensive field campaigns, ecosystem level monitoring, and physiological modeling. My research has spanned topics from leaf ecophysiology, to eddy covariance flux monitoring & synthesis, ecohydrology, soil respiration and microbial nutrient cycling, and remote sensing using PRI and SIF.
