    title: "Technology Enabled Tropical Reforestation for Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation"
    excerpt: "My current research focuses on Nature based Climate Solutions (NbCS), such as tropical forest restoration projects that increase carbon storage while restoring healthy ecosystems and biodiversity. However, assessing the potential and impacts of NbCS projects is complex and large uncertainties remain a major barrier to successful implementation. This research seeks to develop predictive tools based on process-based land surface modeling (CLM-FATES) to support robust, scalable, and credible reforestation strategies in tropical ecosystems. Ultimately this work seeks to build an open-access database to facilitate actionable restoration projects worldwide and across diverse stakeholders."
