    title: "Machine Learning Upscaling of Terrestrial Carbon Fluxes"
    excerpt: "**Photosynthesis** constitutes the largest yet most uncertain flux in the terrestrial carbon cycle. Ecosystem-level photosynthesis, often termed as Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), can be measured from networks of eddy covariance flux towers. Flux sites, however, are only sparsely and evenly distributed, and thus unable to inform the spatial and temporal dynamics of GPP at the global scale. Here we combine machine learning and physical constraints to upscale GPP measurements from flux tower sites to wall-to-wall global maps. We aim to reconstruct the temporal GPP dynamics induced by both climate (such as CO2) and land surface changes."

    title: "Quantifying vegetation structural dynamics"
    excerpt: >
        Leaf area index (LAI) is a structural biophysical variable describing the amount leaves that plant canopies have. Robust estimation of LAI is critical understand carbon, water, and enbergy exchange between plant, soil, atmosphere. I use statistical and machine learning approaches to quantify LAI from local to global scales at high (decametric) spatial resolutions and evaluate how uncertainties in LAI estimation impact the modeling of water fluxes. <br />

    title: "Forecasting crop yields"
    excerpt: >
        Robust and timely estimations of crop yields in a spatially explicit manner provide essential information to farmers, private partners, and policy-makers. I employ both machine learning and crop growth modeling approaches to improve the accuracy and reliability of crop yield estimations across spatial scales over large areas.  For example, I developed a hierarchical data assimilation framework to combine mechanistic crop modeling and satellite observations to estimate crop yield at individual field levels in the Midwest US. I also explored the strength of novel machine/deep learning algorithms to provide a timely forecast of yields at county levels. <br />
